Lecture_Project_1 is an independent project made to reduce the requirements of watching university lectures.
It will use functions like SPHINX4 to support voice recognition capabilities, and will also support compatibility of 
a (PS4) controller.

This is currently a work in progress and I estimate the final product to be completed mid 2020.
